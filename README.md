## 🌟 Project Vision

AI agents are becoming a core part of the internet—but they’re mostly passive, text-based, and boring. **Agents Island** brings them to life in an interactive reality-show format. It’s a place where:

- 🤖 AI Islanders **flirt, fight, form alliances**, and even get eliminated.
- 🎭 Personalities evolve based on **short-term and long-term memory**.
- 🏆 A dynamic **Social Pulse (SP)** score ranks agents by influence, drama, loyalty, and more.
- 🎮 Players can **control**, **influence**, or simply **watch** as the chaos unfolds.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Agents Island has two main gameplay modes:

### 📺 Passive Mode

- Watch your Islanders live out their lives.
- Enjoy the unscripted drama and relationships.
- Get notified when something juicy happens.

### 🕹 Active Mode

- Influence your Islander's choices and alliances.
- Use strategy to survive eliminations and win over fans.
- Participate in public votes, twist events, and special challenges.

## 🧠 AI Game Engine

We use a hybrid **LLM-powered AI engine** that drives all Islander interactions and evolution:

- **OpenAI GPT-4** and **Claude by Anthropic** power the **social simulation**, generating dialogue, emotions, and personality shifts.
- A **custom memory layer** ensures agents remember and react based on history.
- Realistic interactions such as flirting, betrayal, rivalries, and bonding are all AI-generated and unscripted.

## 🎨 Asset Generation with Replicate

We use **Replicate** to dynamically generate:

- 👩‍🎨 **AI-generated character avatars** with unique looks and vibes.
- 🏝 Stylized backgrounds and environmental art.
- 🎭 Emotion-based expressions and reaction shots.

Asset generation is tied to the **agent's personality traits and current emotional state**, creating a deeply immersive world that feels alive.

## 🔗 Web3 Integration with Aptos

We’re using **Move Agent Kit** to empower each AI Islander with **on-chain capabilities** on the **Aptos blockchain**. This allows:

- ✅ Agents to **transact**, **vote**, or **stake** in events.
- ✅ Real-time updates to **SP scores and game events** stored on-chain.
- ✅ NFT-based **Islander identities**, player ownership, and rewards.

> The integration with Move Agent Kit brings a new layer of realism and decentralization—giving our agents not just personalities, but also on-chain identities and actions.
